## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Azure  Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools)

## Setup

### Frontend
Switch to the "frontend" directory.

Run `npm start`.

### Key concepts

The "frontend" folder contains a single `index.html` file. This file defines the interface for the Products Manager application. It references the Bulma CSS framework, the Vue.js JavaScript framework, and a reference to the `index.js` file.

The `index.js` file is a single Vue.js object which the `index.html` file needs to properly function. This `index.js` file contains all of the application logic, binding code and AJAX requests.

### Api
Switch to the "api" directory

Run `func start`
